# RecommenderBERT

RecommenderBERT is a highly adaptable, text-based recommendation system designed to deliver personalized content suggestions and filtering through a robust API. Built with versatility in mind, it can be applied to virtually any domain requiring intelligent recommendations, from digital content platforms to e-commerce, education, and beyond. While the developer has chosen YouTube content filtering as an initial use case, RecommenderBERT’s core strength lies in its universal applicability, leveraging BERT’s advanced natural language processing to process and analyze textual and contextual data for any recommendation task.

## Overview

RecommenderBERT is a domain-agnostic recommendation engine that processes diverse data inputs to provide tailored suggestions. Its flexible architecture allows it to adapt to any scenario where personalized recommendations or content filtering are needed. For the developer’s chosen use case—filtering YouTube content—it evaluates:

-   **Video watch time:** Duration a user spends watching a video.
-   **Video length:** Total duration of the video.
-   **Thumbnail text:** Text embedded in video thumbnails.
-   **Channel subscriber count:** Number of subscribers to the video’s channel.
-   **Video views:** Total view count of the video.
-   **Video description:** Text in the video’s description field.
-   **User activity:** User’s interaction patterns (e.g., likes, comments, shares).

However, this is just one application. RecommenderBERT can be seamlessly repurposed for tasks like recommending products, articles, courses, or even social media posts, making it a universal tool for personalized recommendation systems.

## Features

-   **Universal Applicability:** Deployable across industries—e-commerce, media, education, healthcare, and more—wherever text-based recommendations are needed.
-   **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailors suggestions based on user behavior and contextual data, regardless of the domain.
-   **Content Filtering:** Filters out irrelevant or low-quality content using BERT’s deep text understanding.
-   **Scalable API:** Offers a flexible, easy-to-integrate API for any platform or application.
-   **BERT-Powered:** Harnesses BERT’s state-of-the-art NLP capabilities for robust text analysis.
-   **Highly Customizable:** Easily adapts to new use cases with minimal reconfiguration.

## Example Use Case: YouTube Content Filtering

As a demonstration of its capabilities, the developer has applied RecommenderBERT to filter low-quality ("yellow") YouTube content and recommend valuable videos. In this context, the system:

-   **Detects Low-Quality Content:** Identifies sensational or misleading videos based on thumbnail text, descriptions, and engagement metrics.
-   **Recommends High-Value Content:** Suggests relevant, high-quality videos tailored to user preferences.
-   **Learns from Users:** Adapts recommendations based on individual interaction patterns.

This YouTube use case is merely an example. RecommenderBERT can just as effectively recommend products in an online store, prioritize news articles, or suggest learning resources, depending on the provided data and configuration.

## Universal Applications

RecommenderBERT’s flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of scenarios, including but not limited to:

-   **E-commerce:** Suggesting products based on user browsing history, product descriptions, and reviews.
-   **News Platforms:** Filtering out clickbait and recommending credible articles based on user reading habits.
-   **Education:** Recommending courses or study materials tailored to a learner’s progress and interests.
-   **Social Media:** Prioritizing posts or accounts based on user engagement and content relevance.
-   **Healthcare:** Suggesting relevant medical resources or articles based on patient queries and history.

Wherever text data exists, RecommenderBERT can analyze and recommend with precision.

## API Usage

RecommenderBERT’s API is designed for universal integration, allowing developers to submit domain-specific data and receive tailored recommendations.

**Endpoint:** `/recommend`
**Method:** `POST`
**Description:** Accepts contextual data (e.g., user behavior, item metadata) and returns personalized recommendations.

**Request Body (Example for YouTube, but adaptable to any domain):**

```json
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "item_data": {
    "item_id": "abc123",
    "interaction_time": 120,
    "item_length": 300,
    "title_text": "Click here for secrets!",
    "context_metric1": 10000,
    "context_metric2": 50000,
    "description": "Amazing tips to boost your productivity"
  },
  "user_activity": {
    "likes": 1,
    "comments": 0,
    "shares": 0
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "item_id": "abc123",
  "recommendation": "relevant",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "suggested_items": [
    {"item_id": "def456", "title": "Top 5 Productivity Hacks"},
    {"item_id": "ghi789", "title": "How to Stay Focused"}
  ]
}
```

## Running the API

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Training the Model

RecommenderBERT is pre-trained on a BERT model and can be fine-tuned for any recommendation task. To fine-tune:

1.  Prepare a domain-specific dataset with labeled items (e.g., "relevant" or "irrelevant").
2.  Use the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --output_dir /path/to/model
    ```
3.  Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model --test_data /path/to/test_dataset
    ```

## Future Horizons

RecommenderBERT’s universal design opens endless possibilities:

-   **Retail:** Personalized product recommendations based on user reviews and purchase history.
-   **Content Platforms:** Filtering and suggesting podcasts, blogs, or videos across any platform.
-   **Professional Development:** Recommending tailored training programs or certifications.
-   **Gaming:** Suggesting in-game items or strategies based on player behavior.

Its adaptability ensures it can evolve with any recommendation challenge.
