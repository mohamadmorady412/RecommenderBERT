# RecommenderBERT

RecommenderBERT is a versatile, text-based recommendation system designed to provide personalized content filtering and suggestions through an API. Its primary use case is to filter out low-quality ("yellow") content on platforms like YouTube and recommend high-value content tailored to individual users. The system leverages a BERT-based architecture to process textual and contextual data, making it adaptable for various recommendation tasks.

## Overview

RecommenderBERT processes multiple data points to evaluate and recommend content. For its initial application in YouTube content filtering, it analyzes:

- **Video watch time:** Duration a user spends watching a video.
- **Video length:** Total duration of the video.
- **Thumbnail text:** Text embedded in video thumbnails.
- **Channel subscriber count:** Number of subscribers to the video’s channel.
- **Video views:** Total view count of the video.
- **Video description:** Text in the video’s description field.
- **User activity:** User’s interaction patterns with the video (e.g., likes, comments, shares).

Using these features, RecommenderBERT identifies and hides low-quality ("yellow") content while promoting useful, relevant videos based on personalized user preferences.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailors content suggestions based on individual user behavior and preferences.
- **Content Filtering:** Detects and hides low-quality or irrelevant content using advanced text analysis.
- **Scalable API:** Provides a flexible API for integration into various platforms or applications.
- **BERT-Powered:** Utilizes BERT’s natural language processing capabilities for robust text understanding.
- **Customizable:** Can be adapted for other recommendation tasks beyond YouTube content filtering.

## Use Case: YouTube Content Filtering

The first application of RecommenderBERT focuses on combating the proliferation of low-quality YouTube content. By analyzing video metadata and user behavior, the system:

- **Identifies Yellow Content:** Detects sensational or misleading videos based on thumbnail text, description, and engagement metrics.
- **Promotes Valuable Content:** Recommends videos with higher relevance and quality, inferred from user watch patterns and content attributes.
- **Adapts to User Behavior:** Continuously learns from user interactions to refine recommendations over time.

## Example Workflow

1.  A user watches a YouTube video.
2.  RecommenderBERT collects data: watch time, video metadata (title, description, thumbnail text), channel stats, and user activity.
3.  The system processes this data through its BERT-based model to classify the video as "yellow" or "useful."
4.  Low-quality content is filtered out, and high-quality videos are prioritized in the user’s recommendations.

## Installation

To set up RecommenderBERT for development or deployment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/xai/RecommenderBERT.git](https://github.com/xai/RecommenderBERT.git)

# Navigate to the project directory
cd RecommenderBERT

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

  - Python 3.8+
  - PyTorch
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - FastAPI (for API deployment)
  - Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)
  - See `requirements.txt` for a full list.

## API Usage

RecommenderBERT provides a RESTful API for integration. Below is an example of how to interact with the API:

**Endpoint:** `/recommend`
**Method:** `POST`
**Description:** Submits video metadata and user data to receive content recommendations.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "video_data": {
    "video_id": "abc123",
    "watch_time": 120,
    "video_length": 300,
    "thumbnail_text": "Click here for secrets!",
    "subscriber_count": 10000,
    "view_count": 50000,
    "description": "Amazing tips to boost your productivity"
  },
  "user_activity": {
    "likes": 1,
    "comments": 0,
    "shares": 0
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "video_id": "abc123",
  "recommendation": "useful",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "suggested_videos": [
    {"video_id": "def456", "title": "Top 5 Productivity Hacks"},
    {"video_id": "ghi789", "title": "How to Stay Focused"}
  ]
}
```

## Running the API

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Training the Model

RecommenderBERT is pre-trained on a BERT model and fine-tuned for recommendation tasks. To fine-tune on your dataset:

1.  Prepare a dataset with labeled videos (e.g., "yellow" or "useful").
2.  Use the provided training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --output_dir /path/to/model
    ```
3.  Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model --test_data /path/to/test_dataset
    ```

## Future Horizons

While the initial focus is YouTube content filtering, RecommenderBERT’s flexible architecture allows it to be adapted for:

  - E-commerce product recommendations
  - News article filtering
  - Social media content prioritization
  - Personalized learning resource suggestions
